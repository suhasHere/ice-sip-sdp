[[intro]]
== Introduction

This document describes how Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is used 
with Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer <<RFC3264>>. The ICE specification 
<<RFC8445>> describes procedures that are common to all usages of ICE and this document
gives the additional details needed to use ICE with SDP offer/answer.


== Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
this document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119,RFC 2119>>.

Readers should be familiar with the terminology defined in <<RFC3264>>, 
in <<RFC8445>> and the following:

[horizontal]
Default Destination/Candidate: ::
The default destination for a component of a data stream is the transport 
address that would be used by an agent that is not ICE aware. A default 
candidate for a component is one whose transport address matches the default 
destination for that component. For the RTP component, the default connection address 
is in the "c=" line of the SDP, and the port and transport protocol  are in 
the "m=" line. For the RTCP component, the address and port are indicated 
using the "a=rtcp" attribute defined in <<RFC3605>>, if present; otherwise, 
the RTCP component address is same as the address of the RTP component, and 
its port is one greater than the port of the RTP component.


== SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

=== Introduction

<<RFC8445>> defines ICE candidate exchange as the process for ICE 
agents (Initiator and Responder) to exchange their candidate information 
required for ICE processing at the agents. For the purposes of this 
specification, the candidate exchange process corresponds to the <<RFC3264>> 
Offer/Answer protocol and the terminologies offerer and answerer correspond 
to the initiator and responder terminologies from <<RFC8445>> respectively.

Once the initiating agent has gathered, pruned and prioritized its 
set of candidates <<RFC8445>>, the candidate exchange with the peer agent begins.

=== Generic Procedures

[[sec-encoding]]
==== Encoding

<<sec-grammar>>  provides detailed rules for constructing various SDP 
attributes defined in this specification.

===== Data Streams

Each data stream <<RFC8445>> is represented by an SDP media description ("m=" section).

===== Candidates

With in a "m=" section, each candidate (including the default candidate) associated
with the data stream is represented by an SDP candidate attribute.

Prior to nomination, the "c=" line associated with an "m=" section contains 
the connection address of the default candidate, while the "m=" line contains the port 
and transport protocol of the default candidate for that "m=" section.

After nomination, the "c=" line for a given "m=" section contains the 
connection address of the nominated candidate (the local candidate of the 
nominated candidate pair) and the "m=" line contains the port and 
transport protocol corresponding to the nominated candidate for that 
"m=" section.

===== Username and Password

The ICE username is represented by an SDP ice-ufrag attribute and the ICE 
password is represented by an SDP ice-pwd attribute.

===== Lite Implementations

An ICE lite implementation <<RFC8445>> MUST include an SDP ice-lite attribute. 
A full implementation MUST NOT include that attribute.


===== ICE Extensions

An agent uses the SDP ice-options attribute to indicate support of ICE 
extensions.

An agent compliant to this specification MUST include an SDP ice-options 
attribute with an "ice2" attribute value. If an agent receives an SDP offer 
or answer with ICE attributes but without the "ice2" ice-options attribute value, 
the agent assumes that the peer is compliant to <<RFC5245>>.


===== Inactive and Disabled Data Streams

If an "m=" section is marked as inactive <<RFC4566>>, or has a bandwidth 
value of zero <<RFC4566>>, the agent MUST still include ICE related SDP 
attributes.

If the port value associated with an "m=" section is set to zero (implying a 
disabled stream) as defined in section 8.2 of <<RFC3264>>, the agent SHOULD NOT 
include ICE related SDP candidate attributes in that "m=" section, unless an 
SDP extension specifying otherwise is used. 


==== RTP/RTCP Considerations

If an agent utilizes both RTP and RTCP, and separate ports 
are used for RTP and RTCP, the agent MUST include SDP candidate
attributes for both the RTP and RTCP components and SDP rtcp 
attribute SHOULD be included in the "m=" section, as 
described in <<RFC3605>>

In the cases where the port number for the RTCP is one higher than the 
RTP port and RTCP component address is same as the address of the
RTP component, the SDP rtcp attribute MAY be omitted.

If the agent does not utilize RTCP, it indicates that by including b=RS:0 
and b=RR:0 SDP attributes, as described in <<RFC3556>>.


==== Determining Role

The offerer acts as the Initiating agent. The answerer acts as the 
Responding agent. The ICE roles (controlling and controlled) are determined 
using the procedures in <<RFC8445>>.

==== STUN Considerations

Once an agent has provided its local candidates to its peer in an SDP 
offer or answer, the agent MUST be prepared to receive STUN connectivity 
check Binding requests on those candidates.

[[sec-ice-mismatch]]
==== Verifying ICE Support Procedures

The agents will proceed with the ICE procedures defined in <<RFC8445>> and 
this specification if, for each data stream in the SDP it received, the 
default destination for each component of that data stream appears in
a candidate attribute. For example, in the case of RTP, the 
connection address, port and transport protocol are in the 
"c=" and "m=" lines, respectively, appear in a candidate
attribute and the value in the rtcp attribute appears in a candidate
attribute.

If this condition is not met, the agents MUST process the SDP for the
data stream based on normal <<RFC3264>> procedures, without using any 
of the ICE mechanisms described in the remainder of this specification 
with the few exceptions noted below:

. The presence of certain application layer gateways MAY modify 
the transport address information as described in <<sec-alg-sip>>.
The behavior of the responding agent in such a situation is 
implementation defined. Informally, the responding agent MAY 
consider the mismatched transport address information as a 
plausible new candidate learnt from the peer and continue its 
ICE processing with that transport address included. 
Alternatively, the responding agent MAY include an "a=ice-mismatch" 
attribute in its answer and  MAY also omit a=candidate attributes for 
such data streams.

. The transport address from the peer for the default destination 
correspond to IP address values "0.0.0.0"/"::" and port value of "9".
This MUST not be considered as a ICE failure by the peer agent and 
the ICE processing MUST continue as usual.

In some cases, controlling/initiator agent may receive the SDP answer
that may omit "a=candidate" attributes for the data stream, and instead 
include a media level "a=ice-mismatch" attribute.  This signals to the
offerer that the answerer supports ICE, but that ICE processing was not
used for this data stream. In this case, ICE processing MUST be terminated 
for this data stream and <<RFC3264>> procedures MUST be followed instead.

==== SDP Example

The following is an example SDP message that includes ICE attributes 
(lines folded for readability):

....
v=0
o=jdoe 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 10.0.1.1
s=
c=IN IP4 192.0.2.3
t=0 0
a=ice-options:ice2
a=ice-pwd:asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg
a=ice-ufrag:8hhY
m=audio 45664 RTP/AVP 0
b=RS:0
b=RR:0
a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 10.0.1.1 8998 typ host
a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.3 45664 typ srflx raddr
 10.0.1.1 rport 8998
....


=== Initial Offer/Answer Exchange

==== Sending the Initial Offer

When an offerer generates the initial offer, in each "m=" section it MUST 
include SDP candidate attributes for each available candidate associated 
with the "m=" section. In addition, the offerer MUST include an SDP ice-ufrag 
and an SDP ice-pwd attribute in the offer.

It is valid for an offer "m=" line to include no SDP candidate attributes
and with default destination corresponding to the IP address values 
"0.0.0.0"/"::" and port value of "9". This implies that offering agent 
is only going to use peer reflexive candidates or that additional candidates 
would be provided in subsequent signaling messages.

NOTE: Within the scope of this document, "Initial Offer" refers to the first
SDP offer that is sent in order to negotiate usage of ICE. It might, or 
might not, be the initial SDP offer of the SDP session.

NOTE: The procedures in this document only consider "m=" sections associated 
with data streams where ICE is used.

==== Sending the Initial Answer

When an answerer receives an initial offer that indicates 
that the offerer supports ICE, and if the answerer accepts 
the offer and the usage of ICE, in each "m=" section within 
the answer, it MUST include SDP candidate attributes for 
each available candidate associated with the "m=" section. 
In addition, the answerer MUST include an SDP ice-ufrag 
and an SDP ice-pwd attribute in the answer.

In each "m=" line, the answerer MUST use the same transport 
protocol as was used in the offer "m=" line. If none of 
the candidates in the "m=" line in the answer use the same 
transport protocol as indicated in the offer "m=" line, 
then, in order to avoid ICE mismatch, the default destination 
MUST be set to IP address values "0.0.0.0"/"::" and 
port value of "9".

It is also valid for an answer "m=" line to include no SDP 
candidate attributes and with default destination corresponding 
to the IP address values "0.0.0.0"/"::" and port value of "9". 
This implies that answering agent is only going to use peer 
reflexive candidates or that additional candidates would be 
provided in subsequent signaling messages.

Once the answerer has sent the answer, it can start performing 
connectivity checks towards the peer candidates that were provided 
in the offer. 

In certain scenarios when either no candidates were 
provided in the offer or all the provided candidates were 
discarded (say, due to unsupported address type or FQDN name 
resolution failure), the answerer MUST NOT consider this 
as immediate ICE processing failure but instead 
MUST wait for the peer reflexive candidates to arrive 
to carryout the connectivity checks or eventually time out 
on the connectivity checks (see <<draft-holmberg-ice-pac>>).

If the offer does not indicate support of ICE, the answerer 
MUST NOT accept the usage of ICE. If the answerer still accepts 
the offer, the answerer MUST NOT include any ICE related SDP 
attributes in the answer. Instead the answerer will generate 
the answer according to normal offer/answer procedures <<RFC3264>>.

If the answerer detects a possibility of the ICE mismatch, 
procedures described in (<<sec-ice-mismatch>>) are followed. 


==== Receiving the Initial Answer

When an offerer receives an initial answer that indicates that the answerer 
supports ICE, it can start performing connectivity checks towards the peer 
candidates that were provided in the answer.

In certain scenarios when either no candidates were 
provided in the answer or all the provided candidates were 
discarded (say, due to unsupported address type or FQDN name 
resolution failure), the offerer MUST NOT consider this as 
immediate ICE processing failure but instead 
MUST wait for the peer reflexive candidates to arrive to 
carryout the connectivity checks or eventually time out on the 
connectivity checks (see <<draft-holmberg-ice-pac>>).

If the answer does not indicate that the answerer supports ICE, or if the 
answerer included "a=mismatch" attributes for all the active data streams in
the answer, the offerer MUST terminate the usage of ICE for the entire session
<<RFC3264>> procedures MUST be followed instead.

If the answer indicates that the answerer supports ICE and if the
answerer included "a=mismatch" SDP attribute only in some of the active data
streams in the answer, the offerer MUST terminate the usage of ICE only for these
specific data streams and use <<RFC3264>> procedures only for these specific
streams. ICE procedures MUST be used for the data streams where "a=mismatch"
attribute was not included.

If the offerer detects an ICE mismatch for one or more data streams in the
answer, as described in (<<sec-ice-mismatch>>), the offerer MUST terminate
the usage of ICE for the entire session. The subsequent actions taken by the
offerer are implementation dependent and are out of the scope of this
specification.

==== Concluding ICE

Once the state of each check list is Completed, and if the agent is
the controlling agent, it nominates a candidate pair <<RFC8445>> and 
checks for each data stream whether the nominated pair matches the default 
candidate pair. If there are one or more data streams with a match, and 
the peer did not indicate support for the 'ice2' ice-option,
the controlling agent MUST generate a subsequent offer 
(<<sec-send-subsequent-offer>>), in which the connection address, port and 
transport protocol in the "c=" and "m=" lines associated 
with each data stream match the corresponding local information of the 
nominated pair for that data stream.

However, If the support for 'ice2' ice-option is in use, the nominated 
candidate is noted and sent in the subsequent offer/answer exchange as 
the default candidate and no updated offer is needed to fix the default 
candidate.

Also as described in <<RFC8445>>, once the controlling agent has nominated 
a candidate pair for a data stream, the agent MUST NOT nominate another pair 
for that data stream during the lifetime of the ICE session (i.e. until 
ICE is restarted).


=== Subsequent Offer/Answer Exchanges

Either agent MAY generate a subsequent offer at any time allowed by
<<RFC3264>>. This section defines rules for construction of subsequent 
offers and answers.

Should a subsequent offer fail, ICE processing continues as if the 
subsequent offer had never been made.

[[sec-send-subsequent-offer]]
==== Sending Subsequent Offer

===== Procedures for All Implementations

[[sec-suboffer-restarts]]
====== ICE Restarts

An agent MAY restart ICE processing for an existing data stream <<RFC8445>>.

The rules governing the ICE restart imply that setting the connection address 
in the "c=" line to 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4)/ :: (for IPv6) will cause an ICE restart.
Consequently, ICE implementations MUST NOT utilize this mechanism for call hold, 
and instead MUST use a=inactive and a=sendonly as described in <<RFC3264>>.

To restart ICE, an agent MUST change both the ice-pwd and the ice-ufrag for 
the data stream in an offer. However, it is permissible to use a session-level 
attribute in one offer, but to provide the same ice-pwd or ice-ufrag as a 
media-level attribute in a subsequent offer. This MUST NOT be considered 
as ICE restart.

An agent sets the rest of the ice related fields in the SDP for this data stream as it 
would in an initial offer of this data stream (see <<sec-encoding>>).
Consequently, the set of candidates MAY include some, none, or all of the 
previous candidates for that data stream and MAY include a totally new set of 
candidates.

====== Removing a Data Stream

If an agent removes a data stream by setting its port to zero, it MUST NOT 
include any candidate attributes for that data stream and SHOULD NOT include 
any other ICE-related attributes defined in <<sec-grammar>> for that data stream.

====== Adding a Data Stream

If an agent wishes to add a new data stream, it sets the fields in the SDP for 
this data stream as if this was an initial offer for that data stream 
(see <<sec-encoding>>). This will cause ICE processing to begin for this data stream.

===== Procedures for Full Implementations

This section describes additional procedures for full implementations, 
covering existing data streams.

====== Before Nomination

When an offerer sends a subsequent offer; in each "m=" section for which a 
candidate pair has not yet been nominated, the offer MUST include the 
same set of ICE-related information that the offerer included in the 
previous offer or answer. The agent MAY include additional candidates 
it did not offer previously, but which it has gathered since the last 
offer/ answer exchange, including peer reflexive candidates.

The agent MAY change the default destination for media. As with initial 
offers, there MUST be a set of candidate attributes in the offer matching 
this default destination.


====== After Nomination

Once a candidate pair has been nominated for a data stream, the connection address, 
port and transport protocol in each "c=" and "m=" line associated with that data 
stream MUST match the data associated with the nominated pair for that 
data stream. In addition, the offerer only includes SDP candidates 
representing the local candidates of the nominated candidate pair. The 
offerer MUST NOT include any other SDP candidate attributes in the 
subsequent offer.

In addition, if the agent is controlling, it MUST include the 
a=remote-candidates attribute for each data stream whose check list 
is in the completed state. The attribute contains the remote candidates 
corresponding to the nominated pair in the valid list for each 
component of that data stream. It is needed to avoid a race condition 
whereby the controlling agent chooses its pairs, but the updated offer 
beats the connectivity checks to the controlled agent, which doesn't 
even know these pairs are valid, let alone selected.  See Appendix B 
for elaboration on this race condition.

===== Procedures for Lite Implementations

If the ICE state is running, a lite implementation MUST include all of 
its candidates for each component of each data stream in a=candidate 
attribute in any subsequent offer. The candidates are formed identical 
to the procedures for initial offers.

A lite implementation MUST NOT add additional host candidates in a
subsequent offer.  If an agent needs to offer additional candidates, 
it MUST restart ICE. Similarly, the username fragments or passwords 
MUST remain the same as used previously.  If an agent needs to change 
one of these, it MUST restart ICE for that data stream.

If ICE has completed for a data stream and if the agent is controlled, 
the default destination for that data stream MUST be set to the 
remote candidate of the candidate pair for that component in the valid list.
For a lite implementation, there is always just a single candidate pair in 
the valid list for each component of a data stream. Additionally, the agent 
MUST include a candidate attribute for each default destination.

If ICE state is completed and if the agent is controlling (which only 
happens when both agents are lite), the agent MUST include the 
a=remote-candidates attribute for each data stream.  The attribute 
contains the remote candidates from the candidate pairs in the 
valid list (one pair for each component of each data stream).

[[sec-subsequent-answer]]
==== Sending Subsequent Answer

If ICE is Completed for a data stream, and the offer for that data 
stream lacked the a=remote-candidates attribute, the rules for 
construction of the answer are identical to those for the offerer, 
except that the answerer MUST NOT include the a=remote-candidates 
attribute in the answer.

A controlled agent will receive an offer with the a=remote-candidates 
attribute for a data stream when its peer has concluded ICE processing 
for that data stream. This attribute is present in the 
offer to deal with a race condition between the receipt of the offer, 
and the receipt of the Binding Response that tells the answerer the 
candidate that will be selected by ICE. See Appendix B for an 
explanation of this race condition. Consequently, processing of an 
offer with this attribute depends on the winner of the race.

The agent forms a candidate pair for each component of the data stream by:

   - Setting the remote candidate equal to the offerer's default
   destination for that component (i.e. the contents of the "m=" and
   "c=" lines for RTP, and the a=rtcp attribute for RTCP)

   - Setting the local candidate equal to the transport address for
   that same component in the a=remote-candidates attribute in the
   offer.

The agent then sees if each of these candidate pairs is present 
in the valid list.  If a particular pair is not in the valid list, 
the check has "lost" the race.  Call such a pair a "losing pair".

The agent finds all the pairs in the check list whose remote 
candidates equal the remote candidate in the losing pair:

   - If none of the pairs are In-Progress, and at least one is Failed,
   it is most likely that a network failure, such as a network
   partition or serious packet loss, has occurred.  The agent SHOULD
   generate an answer for this data stream as if the remote-
   candidates attribute had not been present, and then restart ICE
   for this stream.

   - If at least one of the pairs is In-Progress, the agent SHOULD wait
   for those checks to complete, and as each completes, redo the
   processing in this section until there are no losing pairs.

Once there are no losing pairs, the agent can generate the answer. 
It MUST set the default destination for media to the candidates in
the remote-candidates attribute from the offer (each of which will
now be the local candidate of a candidate pair in the valid list).
It MUST include a candidate attribute in the answer for each
candidate in the remote-candidates attribute in the offer.


===== ICE Restart

If the offerer in a subsequent offer requested an ICE restart 
for a data stream, and if the answerer accepts the offer, the 
answerer follows the procedures for generating an initial answer. 

For a given data stream, the answerer MAY include the same 
candidates that were used in the previous ICE session, but 
it MUST change the SDP ice-pwd and ice-ufrag attribute 
values.

===== Lite Implementation specific procedures

If the received offer contains the remote-candidates attribute for a 
data stream, the agent forms a candidate pair for each component of the 
data stream by:

- Setting the remote candidate equal to the offerer's default destination 
for that component (i.e., the contents of the "m=" and "c=" lines for RTP, 
and the a=rtcp attribute for RTCP).

- Setting the local candidate equal to the transport address for that same 
component in the a=remote-candidates attribute in the offer.

The state of ICE processing for that data stream is set to Completed.

Furthermore, if the agent believed it was controlling, but the offer contained 
the a=remote-candidates attribute, both agents believe they are controlling.
In this case, both would have sent updated offers around the same time.

However, the signaling protocol carrying the offer/answer exchanges 
will have resolved this glare condition, so that one agent is always 
the 'winner' by having its offer received before its peer has sent 
an offer. The winner takes the role of controlling, so that the 
loser (the answerer under consideration in this section) MUST 
change its role to controlled.

Consequently, if the agent was going to send an updated offer since, 
based on the rules in section 8.2 of <<RFC8445>>, it was controlling, 
it no longer needs to.

Besides the potential role change, change in the Valid list, and 
state changes, the construction of the answer is performed identically 
to the construction of an offer.


==== Receiving Answer for a Subsequent Offer

===== Procedures for Full Implementations

There may be certain situations where the offerer receives 
an SDP answer that lacks ICE candidates although the initial answer 
did. One example of such an "unexpected" answer might be
happen when an ICE-unaware B2BUA introduces a media server during 
call hold using 3rd party call-control procedures. Omitting 
further details how this is done, this could result in an answer being
received at the holding UA that was constructed by the B2BUA. With
the B2BUA being ICE-unaware, that answer would not include ICE
candidates.

Receiving an answer without ICE attributes in this situation might be
unexpected, but would not necessarily impair the user experience.


When the offerer receives an answer indicating support for ICE, the 
offer performs on of the following actions:
	
	- If the offer was a restart, the agent MUST perform ICE restart
	procedures as specified in <<sec-restart-subsequent>>

	- If the offer/answer exchange removed a data stream, or an 
	answer rejected an offered data stream, an agent MUST flush the 
	Valid list for that data stream. It MUST also terminate any 
	STUN transactions in progress for that data stream.

	- If the offer/answer exchange added a new data stream, the agent 
	MUST create a new check list for it (and an empty Valid list to 
	start of course) which in turn triggers the candidate 
	processing procedures <<RFC8445>>.

	- If ICE state is running for a given data stream, the agent 
	recomputes the check list. If a pair on the new check list was 
	also on the previous check list, and its state is not Frozen, 
  its state is copied over. Otherwise, its state 
	is set to Frozen. If none of the check lists are active (meaning 
	that the pairs in each check list are Frozen), appropriate 
	procedures in <<RFC8445>> are performed to move candidate(s) 
	to the Waiting state to further continue ICE processing.

	- If ICE state is completed and the SDP answer conforms to 
   <<sec-subsequent-answer>>, the agent MUST reman in the ICE 
   completed state.

However, if the ICE support is no longer indicated in the SDP answer, 
the agent MUST fall-back to <<RFC3264>> procedures and SHOULD NOT 
drop the dialog because of the missing ICE support or unexpected answer. 
Once the agent sends a new offer later on, it MUST perform an ICE restart.

[[sec-restart-subsequent]]
====== ICE Restarts

The agent MUST remember the nominated pair in the Valid list for each 
component of the data stream, called the previous selected pair prior 
to the restart. The agent will continue to send media using this pair, 
as described in section 12 of <<RFC8445>>. Once these destinations are 
noted, the agent MUST flush the valid and check lists, and then recompute 
the check list and its states, thus triggering the candidate processing 
procedures <<RFC8445>>


===== Procedures for Lite Implementations

If ICE is restarting for a data stream, the agent MUST start a new
Valid list for that data stream. It MUST remember the nominated pair in the
previous Valid list for each component of the data stream, called
the previous selected pairs, and continue to send media there as
described in section 12 of <<RFC8445>>. The state of ICE processing 
for each data stream MUST change to Running, and the state of 
ICE processing MUST change to Running


[[sec-grammar]]
== Grammar

This specification defines eight new SDP attributes -- the "candidate", 
"remote-candidates", "ice-lite", "ice-mismatch", "ice-ufrag", "ice-pwd", "ice-pacing", 
and "ice-options" attributes. 

This section also provides non-normative examples of the attributes defined.

The syntax for the attributes follow Augmented BNF as defined in <<RFC5234>>.

=== "candidate" Attribute

The candidate attribute is a media-level attribute only.
It contains a transport address for a candidate that can be used for connectivity checks.

....
candidate-attribute   = "candidate" ":" foundation SP component-id SP
                        transport SP
                        priority SP
                        connection-address SP     ;from RFC 4566
                        port         ;port from RFC 4566
                        SP cand-type
                        [SP rel-addr]
                        [SP rel-port]
                        *(SP extension-att-name SP
                             extension-att-value)

foundation            = 1*32ice-char
component-id          = 1*5DIGIT
transport             = "UDP" / transport-extension
transport-extension   = token              ; from RFC 3261
priority              = 1*10DIGIT
cand-type             = "typ" SP candidate-types
candidate-types       = "host" / "srflx" / "prflx" / "relay" / token
rel-addr              = "raddr" SP connection-address
rel-port              = "rport" SP port
extension-att-name    = token
extension-att-value   = *VCHAR
ice-char              = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"
....

This grammar encodes the primary information about a candidate: its IP address, 
port and transport protocol, and its properties: the foundation, component ID, priority, 
type, and related transport address:

[horizontal]
<connection-address>: ::  is taken from RFC 4566 [RFC4566].
It is the IP address of the candidate. When parsing this field, an agent
can differentiate an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address by presence
of a colon in its value -- the presence of a colon indicates IPv6.
An agent MUST ignore candidate lines that include candidates with
IP address versions that are not supported or recognized. An IP
address SHOULD be used, but an FQDN MAY be used in place of an IP
address. In that case, when receiving an offer or answer
containing an FQDN in an a=candidate attribute, the FQDN is looked
up in the DNS first using an AAAA record (assuming the agent
supports IPv6), and if no result is found or the agent only
supports IPv4, using an A record. If a FQDN returns multiple 
IP addresses an agent MUST only use one of them throughout the 
duration of the ICE session. Since an agent does not know 
whether the peer listens to the chosen IP address and 
port, it is RECOMMENDED to not use FQDNs that will resolve 
into multiple IP addresses.

<port>: :: is also taken from RFC 4566 <<RFC4566>>.
It is the port of the candidate.

<transport>: :: indicates the transport protocol for the candidate.
This specification only defines UDP. However, extensibility is provided to allow for 
future transport protocols to be used with ICE by extending the sub-registry 
"ICE Transport Protocols" under "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)" registry.


<foundation>: :: is composed of 1 to 32 <ice-char>s.
It is an identifier that is equivalent for two candidates that are of the same type, 
share the same base, and come from the same STUN server.
The foundation is used to optimize ICE performance in the Frozen algorithm as 
described in <<RFC8445>>

<component-id>: :: is a positive integer between 1 and 256 (inclusive) that 
identifies the specific component of the dta stream for which this is a candidate.
It MUST start at 1 and MUST increment by 1 for each component of a particular candidate. 
For data streams based on RTP, candidates for the actual RTP media MUST have a component 
ID of 1, and candidates for RTCP MUST have a component ID of 2.
See section 13 in <<RFC8445>> for additional discussion on extending ICE to new data streams.

<priority>: :: is a positive integer between 1 and (2**31 - 1) inclusive. The procedures 
for computing candidate's priority is described in section 5.1.2 of <<RFC8445>>.

<cand-type>: :: encodes the type of candidate.
This specification defines the values "host", "srflx", "prflx", and "relay" for host, 
server reflexive, peer reflexive, and relayed candidates, respectively.
Specifications for new candidate types MUST define how, if at all, various steps in the ICE 
processing differ from the ones defined by this specification.

<rel-addr> and <rel-port>: :: convey transport addresses related to the candidate, 
useful for diagnostics and other purposes.
<rel-addr> and <rel-port> MUST be present for server reflexive, peer reflexive, 
and relayed candidates. If a candidate is server or peer reflexive, <rel-addr> and 
<rel-port> are equal to the base for that server or peer reflexive candidate. If the 
candidate is relayed, <rel-addr> and <rel-port> are equal to the mapped address in the 
Allocate response that provided the client with that relayed candidate (see 
Appendix B.3 of <<RFC8445>> for a discussion of its purpose).
If the candidate is a host candidate, <rel-addr> and <rel-port> MUST be omitted.

:: In some cases, e.g., for privacy reasons, an agent may not want to reveal the related 
address and port. In this case the address MUST be set to "0.0.0.0" (for IPv4 candidates) 
or "::" (for IPv6 candidates) and the port to zero.

The candidate attribute can itself be extended. The grammar allows for new name/value pairs 
to be added at the end of the attribute. Such extensions MUST be made through IETF Review or
IESG Approval <<RFC5226>> and the assignments MUST contain the specific extension and a 
reference to the document defining the usage of the extension

An implementation MUST ignore any name/value pairs it doesn't understand.

....

Example: SDP line for UDP server reflexive candidate attribute for the RTP component

a=candidate:2 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.3 45664 typ srflx raddr 10.0.1.1 rport 8998

....


=== "remote-candidates" Attribute

The syntax of the "remote-candidates" attribute is defined using Augmented BNF 
as defined in <<RFC5234>>.
The remote-candidates attribute is a media-level attribute only.

....
remote-candidate-att = "remote-candidates:" remote-candidate
                         0*(SP remote-candidate)
remote-candidate = component-ID SP connection-address SP port
....

The attribute contains a connection-address and port for each component. The ordering 
of components is irrelevant. However, a value MUST be present for each component of a 
data stream. This attribute MUST be included in an offer by a controlling agent for 
a data stream that is Completed, and MUST NOT be included in any other case.

....

Example: Remote candidates SDP lines for the RTP and RTCP components:

a=remote-candidates:1 192.0.2.3 45664
a=remote-candidates:2 192.0.2.3 45665

....

=== "ice-lite" and "ice-mismatch" Attributes

The syntax of the "ice-lite" and "ice-mismatch" attributes, both of which are flags, is:

....
ice-lite               = "ice-lite"
ice-mismatch           = "ice-mismatch"
....

"ice-lite" is a session-level attribute only, and indicates that an agent is a 
lite implementation. "ice-mismatch" is a media-level attribute and only 
reported in the answer. It indicates that the offer arrived with a default 
destination for a media component that didn't have a corresponding candidate 
attribute.

=== "ice-ufrag" and "ice-pwd" Attributes

The "ice-ufrag" and "ice-pwd" attributes convey the username fragment and password used by ICE for message integrity.
Their syntax is:

....
ice-pwd-att           = "ice-pwd:" password
ice-ufrag-att         = "ice-ufrag:" ufrag
password              = 22*256ice-char
ufrag                 = 4*256ice-char
....

The "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes can appear at either the session-level 
or media-level. When present in both, the value in the media-level takes precedence.
Thus, the value at the session-level is effectively a default that applies to all 
data streams, unless overridden by a media-level value. Whether present at the session 
or media-level, there MUST be an ice-pwd and ice-ufrag attribute for each data stream.
If two data streams have identical ice-ufrag's, they MUST have identical ice-pwd's.

The ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes MUST be chosen randomly at the beginning of 
a session (the same applies when ICE is restarting for an agent).

The ice-ufrag attribute MUST contain at least 24 bits of randomness, and the ice-pwd 
attribute MUST contain at least 128 bits of randomness. This means that the ice-ufrag 
attribute will be at least 4 characters long, and the ice-pwd at least 22 characters long, 
since the grammar for these attributes allows for 6 bits of information per character.
The attributes MAY be longer than 4 and 22 characters, respectively, of course, up to 
256 characters. The upper limit allows for buffer sizing in implementations.
Its large upper limit allows for increased amounts of randomness to be added over time.
For compatibility with the 512 character limitation for the STUN username attribute value 
and for bandwidth conservation considerations, the ice-ufrag attribute MUST NOT be longer 
than 32 characters when sending, but an implementation  MUST accept up to 256 characters 
when receiving.

....

Example shows sample ice-ufrag and ice-pwd SDP lines:

a=ice-pwd:asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg
a=ice-ufrag:8hhY

....
=== "ice-pacing" Attribute

The "ice-pacing" is a session level attribute that indicates the desired connectivity 
check pacing, in milliseconds, for this agent (see section 14 of <<RFC8445>>).
The syntax is:

....
ice-pacing-att            = "ice-pacing:" pacing-value
pacing-value              = 1*10DIGIT
....

Following the procedures defined in <<RFC8445>>, a default value of 50ms
is used for an agent when ice-pacing attribute is omitted in the offer or
the answer. 

The same rule applies for ice-pacing attribute values lower than 
50ms. This mandates that, if an agent includes the ice-pacing attribute,
its value MUST be greater than 50ms or else a value of 50ms
is considered by default for that agent. 

Also the larger of the ice-pacing attribute values between the offer and
the answer (determined either by the one provided in the ice-pacing attribute 
or by picking the default value) MUST be considered for a given ICE session.

....

Example shows ice-pacing value of 5 ms:

a=ice-pacing:5
....

[[sec-ice-options]]
=== "ice-options" Attribute

The "ice-options" attribute is a session- and media-level attribute.
It contains a series of tokens that identify the options supported by the agent.
Its grammar is:

....
ice-options           = "ice-options:" ice-option-tag
                          0*(SP ice-option-tag)
ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char
....

The existence of an ice-option in an offer indicates that a certain extension 
is supported by the agent and is willing to use it, if the peer agent also includes 
the same extension in the answer. There might be further extension specific 
negotiation needed between the agents that determine how the extensions gets used 
in a given session. The details of the negotiation procedures, if present, MUST be 
defined by the specification defining the extension (see <<sec-iana-ice-options>>).


....
Example shows 'rtp+ecn' ice-option SDP line from <<RFC6679>>:

a=ice-options:rtp+ecn

....

[[sec-keepalive]]
== Keepalives

All the ICE agents MUST follow the procedures defined in section 11 of <<RFC8445>> 
for sending keepalives. The keepalives MUST be sent regardless of whether the 
data stream is currently inactive, sendonly, recvonly, or sendrecv, and regardless 
of the presence or value of the bandwidth attribute. An agent can determine that its 
peer supports ICE by the presence of a=candidate attributes for each media session.


== SIP Considerations

Note that ICE is not intended for NAT traversal for SIP, which is assumed to be 
provided via another mechanism <<RFC5626>>.

When ICE is used with SIP, forking may result in a single offer generating a 
multiplicity of answers. In that case, ICE proceeds completely in parallel and 
independently for each answer, treating the combination of its offer and 
each answer as an independent offer/answer exchange, with its own set of local 
candidates, pairs, check lists, states, and so on. 

Once ICE processing has reached the Completed state for all peers for media 
streams using those candidates, the agent SHOULD wait an additional three seconds, 
and then it MAY cease responding to checks or generating triggered checks on that 
candidate. It MAY free the candidate at that time.
Freeing of server reflexive candidates is never explicit; it happens by lack of 
a keepalive. The three-second delay handles cases when aggressive nomination 
is used, and the selected pairs can quickly change after ICE has completed.


[[sec-latency]]
=== Latency Guidelines

ICE requires a series of STUN-based connectivity checks to take place between 
endpoints. These checks start from the answerer on generation of its answer, 
and start from the offerer when it receives the answer.
These checks can take time to complete, and as such, the selection of 
messages to use with offers and answers can affect perceived user latency.
Two latency figures are of particular interest. These are the post-pickup delay 
and the post-dial delay. The post-pickup delay refers to the time between when 
a user "answers the phone" and when any speech they utter can be delivered to 
the caller. The post-dial delay refers to the time between when a user enters 
the destination address for the user and ringback begins as a consequence of 
having successfully started alerting the called user agent.

Two cases can be considered -- one where the offer is present in the initial 
INVITE and one where it is in a response.

==== Offer in INVITE

To reduce post-dial delays, it is RECOMMENDED that the caller begin gathering 
candidates prior to actually sending its initial INVITE, so that the candidates 
can be provided in the INVITE. This can be started upon 
user interface cues that a call is pending, such as activity on a keypad or 
the phone going off-hook.

On the receipt of the offer, the answerer SHOULD generate an answer in a 
provisional response as soon as it has completed gathering 
the candidates. ICE requires that a provisional response with an SDP be 
transmitted reliably. This can be done through the existing 
Provisional Response Acknowledgment (PRACK) 
mechanism <<RFC3262>> or through an ICE specific optimization, wherein, 
the agent retransmits the provisional response with the exponential backoff 
timers described in <<RFC3262>>. Such retransmissions MUST cease on receipt 
of a STUN Binding request with transport address matching candidate address 
for one of the data streams signaled in that SDP or on transmission of the answer 
in a 2xx response. If no Binding request is received prior to the last retransmit, 
the agent does not consider the session terminated. 
For the ICE lite peers , the agent MUST cease retransmitting the 18x after 
sending it four times since there will be no Binding request sent and 
the number four is arbitrarily chosen to limit the number of 18x retransmits 
('poor man's version of <<RFC3262>>' basically). (ICE will actually work even 
if the peer never receives the 18x; however, experience has shown that sending 
it is important for middleboxes and firewall traversal).

Once the answer has been sent, the agent SHOULD begin its connectivity checks.
Once candidate pairs for each component of a data stream enter the valid list, 
the answerer can begin sending media on that data stream.

However, prior to this point, any media that needs to be sent towards the 
caller (such as SIP early media <<RFC3960>>) MUST NOT be transmitted. For this 
reason, implementations SHOULD delay alerting the called party until candidates 
for each component of each data stream have entered the valid list.
In the case of a PSTN gateway, this would mean that the setup message into the 
PSTN is delayed until this point. Doing this increases the post-dial delay, but 
has the effect of eliminating 'ghost rings'.
Ghost rings are cases where the called party hears the phone ring, picks up, but 
hears nothing and cannot be heard. This technique works without requiring support 
for, or usage of, preconditions <<RFC3312>>. It also has the benefit of guaranteeing 
that not a single packet of media will get clipped, so that post-pickup delay is zero.
If an agent chooses to delay local alerting in this way, it SHOULD generate a 180 
response once alerting begins.

==== Offer in Response

In addition to uses where the offer is in an INVITE, and the answer is in the 
provisional and/or 200 OK response, ICE works with cases where the offer appears 
in the response.
In such cases, which are common in third party call control <<RFC3725>>, ICE 
agents SHOULD generate their offers in a reliable provisional response 
(which MUST utilize <<RFC3262>>), and not alert the user on receipt of the INVITE.
The answer will arrive in a PRACK.
This allows for ICE processing to take place prior to alerting, so that there is no 
post-pickup delay, at the expense of increased call setup delays.
Once ICE completes, the callee can alert the user and then generate a 200 OK 
when they answer.
The 200 OK would contain no SDP, since the offer/answer exchange has completed.

Alternatively, agents MAY place the offer in a 2xx instead (in which case the 
answer comes in the ACK).
When this happens, the callee will alert the user on receipt of the INVITE, 
and the ICE exchanges will take place only after the user answers.
This has the effect of reducing call setup delay, but can cause substantial 
post-pickup delays and media clipping.

=== SIP Option Tags and Media Feature Tags

<<RFC5768>> specifies a SIP option tag and media feature tag for usage with ICE.
ICE implementations using SIP SHOULD support this specification, which uses a 
feature tag in registrations to facilitate interoperability through signaling 
intermediaries.

=== Interactions with Forking

ICE interacts very well with forking.
Indeed, ICE fixes some of the problems associated with forking.
Without ICE, when a call forks and the caller receives multiple incoming 
data streams, it cannot determine which data stream corresponds to 
which callee.

With ICE, this problem is resolved.
The connectivity checks which occur prior to transmission of media carry 
username fragments, which in turn are correlated to a specific callee.
Subsequent media packets that arrive on the same candidate pair as the 
connectivity check will be associated with that same callee.
Thus, the caller can perform this correlation as long as it has received an answer.

=== Interactions with Preconditions

Quality of Service (QoS) preconditions, which are defined in <<RFC3312>> 
and <<RFC4032>>, apply only to the transport addresses listed as the default 
targets for media in an offer/answer.
If ICE changes the transport address where media is received, this change 
is reflected in an updated offer that changes the default destination for 
media to match ICE's selection. As such, it appears like any other re-INVITE would, 
and is fully treated in RFCs 3312 and 4032, which apply without regard to the fact 
that the destination for media is changing due to ICE negotiations occurring 
"in the background".

Indeed, an agent SHOULD NOT indicate that QoS preconditions have been met 
until the checks have completed and selected the candidate pairs to be used for media.

ICE also has (purposeful) interactions with connectivity preconditions <<RFC5898>>.
Those interactions are described there.
	Note that the procedures described in <<sec-latency>> describe their own type of "preconditions", albeit with less functionality than those provided by the explicit preconditions in <<RFC5898>>.

=== Interactions with Third Party Call Control

ICE works with Flows I, III, and IV as described in <<RFC3725>>.
Flow I works without the controller supporting or being aware of ICE.
Flow IV will work as long as the controller passes along the ICE attributes without alteration.
Flow II is fundamentally incompatible with ICE; each agent will believe itself to be the answerer and thus never generate a re-INVITE.

The flows for continued operation, as described in Section 7 of <<RFC3725>>, require additional behavior of ICE implementations to support.
In particular, if an agent receives a mid-dialog re-INVITE that contains no offer, it MUST restart ICE for each data stream and go through the process of gathering new candidates.
Furthermore, that list of candidates SHOULD include the ones currently being used for media.

== Relationship with ANAT

<<RFC4091>>, the Alternative Network Address Types (ANAT) Semantics for the SDP grouping framework, and <<RFC4092>>, its usage with SIP, define a mechanism for indicating that an agent can support both IPv4 and IPv6 for a data stream, and it does so by including two "m=" lines, one for v4 and one for v6.  This is similar to ICE, which allows for an agent to indicate multiple transport addresses using the candidate attribute.  However, ANAT relies on static selection to pick between choices, rather than a dynamic connectivity check used by ICE.

It is RECOMMENDED that ICE be used in realizing the dual-stack use-cases in agents that support ICE.

== Security Considerations

=== Attacks on the Offer/Answer Exchanges

An attacker that can modify or disrupt the offer/answer exchanges themselves can readily launch a variety of attacks with ICE.
They could direct media to a target of a DoS attack, they could insert themselves into the data stream, and so on.
These are similar to the general security considerations for offer/answer exchanges, and the security considerations in <<RFC3264>> apply.
These require techniques for message integrity and encryption for offers and answers, which are satisfied by the TLS mechanism <<RFC3261>> when SIP is used.
As such, the usage of TLS with ICE is RECOMMENDED.

=== Insider Attacks

In addition to attacks where the attacker is a third party trying to insert fake offers, answers, or STUN messages, there are several attacks possible with ICE when the attacker is an authenticated and valid participant in the ICE exchange.

[[sec-voice-hammer]]
==== The Voice Hammer Attack

The voice hammer attack is an amplification attack.
In this attack, the attacker initiates sessions to other agents, and maliciously includes 
the connection address and port of a DoS target as the destination for media traffic 
signaled in the SDP. This causes substantial amplification; a single offer/answer exchange 
can create a continuing flood of media packets, possibly at high rates (consider video sources).
This attack is not specific to ICE, but ICE can help provide remediation.

Specifically, if ICE is used, the agent receiving the malicious SDP will first perform connectivity checks to the target of media before sending media there.
If this target is a third-party host, the checks will not succeed, and media is never sent.

Unfortunately, ICE doesn't help if it's not used, in which case an attacker could simply send the offer without the ICE parameters.
However, in environments where the set of clients is known, and is limited to ones that support ICE, the server can reject any offers or answers that don't indicate ICE support.

SIP User Agents (UA) <<RFC3261>> that are not willing to receive non-ICE answers MUST include an "ice" Option Tag in the SIP Require Header Field in their offer.
UAs that rejects non-ICE offers SHOULD use a 421 response code, together with an Option Tag "ice" in the Require Header Field in the response.

[[sec-alg-sip]]
==== Interactions with Application Layer Gateways and SIP

Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) are functions present in a Network Address Translation (NAT) device that inspect the contents of packets and modify them, in order to facilitate NAT traversal for application protocols.
Session Border Controllers (SBCs) are close cousins of ALGs, but are less transparent since they actually exist as application-layer SIP intermediaries.
ICE has interactions with SBCs and ALGs.

If an ALG is SIP aware but not ICE aware, ICE will work through it as long as the ALG correctly modifies the SDP.
A correct ALG implementation behaves as follows:

* The ALG does not modify the "m=" and "c=" lines or the rtcp attribute if they contain external addresses.
* If the "m=" and "c=" lines contain internal addresses, the modification depends on the state of the ALG:
[empty]
** If the ALG already has a binding established that maps an external port to an internal connection address and port matching the values in the "m=" and "c=" lines or rtcp attribute, the ALG uses that binding instead of creating a new one.
** If the ALG does not already have a binding, it creates a new one and modifies the SDP, rewriting the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute.

Unfortunately, many ALGs are known to work poorly in these corner cases.
ICE does not try to work around broken ALGs, as this is outside the scope of its functionality.
ICE can help diagnose these conditions, which often show up as a mismatch between the set of candidates and the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attributes.
The ice-mismatch attribute is used for this purpose.

ICE works best through ALGs when the signaling is run over TLS.
This prevents the ALG from manipulating the SDP messages and interfering with ICE operation.
Implementations that are expected to be deployed behind ALGs SHOULD provide for TLS transport of the SDP.

If an SBC is SIP aware but not ICE aware, the result depends on the behavior of the SBC.
If it is acting as a proper Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), the SBC will remove any SDP attributes it doesn't understand, including the ICE attributes.
Consequently, the call will appear to both endpoints as if the other side doesn't support ICE.
This will result in ICE being disabled, and media flowing through the SBC, if the SBC has requested it.
If, however, the SBC passes the ICE attributes without modification, yet modifies the default destination for media (contained in the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute), this will be detected as an ICE mismatch, and ICE processing is aborted for the call.
It is outside of the scope of ICE for it to act as a tool for "working around" SBCs.
If one is present, ICE will not be used and the SBC techniques take precedence.

[[sec-iana-ice-options]]
=== Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Options Registry

IANA maintains a registry for ice-options identifiers under the Specification 
Required policy as defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations 
Section in RFCs" <<RFC5226>>.

ICE options are of unlimited length according to the syntax in 
<<sec-ice-options>>; however, they are RECOMMENDED to be no longer 
than 20 characters. This is to reduce message sizes and allow for 
efficient parsing. ICE options are defined at the session leve..

A registration request MUST include the following information:

- The ICE option identifier to be registered
- Name, Email, and Address of a contact person for the registration
- Organization or individuals having the change control
- Short description of the ICE extension to which the option relates
- Reference(s) to the specification defining the ICE option and the related extensions

[[sec-why-remote]]
== The remote-candidates Attribute

The a=remote-candidates attribute exists to eliminate a race condition between the updated offer and the response to the STUN Binding request that moved a candidate into the Valid list.
This race condition is shown in <<fig-race-flow>>.
On receipt of message 4, agent L adds a candidate pair to the valid list.
If there was only a single data stream with a single component, agent L could now send an updated offer.
However, the check from agent R has not yet generated a response, and agent R receives the updated offer (message 7) before getting the response (message 9).
Thus, it does not yet know that this particular pair is valid.
To eliminate this condition, the actual candidates at R that were selected by the offerer (the remote candidates) are included in the offer itself, and the answerer delays its answer until those pairs validate.

== Why Is the Conflict Resolution Mechanism Needed?

When ICE runs between two peers, one agent acts as controlled, and the other as controlling.
Rules are defined as a function of implementation type and offerer/answerer to determine who is controlling and who is controlled.
However, the specification mentions that, in some cases, both sides might believe they are controlling, or both sides might believe they are controlled.
How can this happen?

The condition when both agents believe they are controlled shows up in third party call control cases.
Consider the following flow:

[[fig-conflict]]
.Role Conflict Flow
....
          A         Controller          B
          |(1) INV()     |              |
          |<-------------|              |
          |(2) 200(SDP1) |              |
          |------------->|              |
          |              |(3) INV()     |
          |              |------------->|
          |              |(4) 200(SDP2) |
          |              |<-------------|
          |(5) ACK(SDP2) |              |
          |<-------------|              |
          |              |(6) ACK(SDP1) |
          |              |------------->|
....

This flow is a variation on flow III of RFC 3725 <<RFC3725>>.
In fact, it works better than flow III since it produces fewer messages.
In this flow, the controller sends an offerless INVITE to agent A, which responds with its offer, SDP1.
The agent then sends an offerless INVITE to agent B, which it responds to with its offer, SDP2.
The controller then uses the offer from each agent to generate the answers.
When this flow is used, ICE will run between agents A and B, but both will believe they are in the controlling role.
With the role conflict resolution procedures, this flow will function properly when ICE is used.

At this time, there are no documented flows that can result in the case where both agents believe they are controlled.
However, the conflict resolution procedures allow for this case, should a flow arise that would fit into this category.

== Why Send an Updated Offer?

Section 11.1 describes rules for sending media.
Both agents can send media once ICE checks complete, without waiting for an updated offer.
Indeed, the only purpose of the updated offer is to "correct" the SDP so that the default destination for media matches where media is being sent based on ICE procedures (which will be the highest-priority nominated candidate pair).

This begs the question -- why is the updated offer/answer exchange needed at all?
Indeed, in a pure offer/answer environment, it would not be.
The offerer and answerer will agree on the candidates to use through ICE, and then can begin using them.
As far as the agents themselves are concerned, the updated offer/answer provides no new information.
However, in practice, numerous components along the signaling path look at the SDP information.
These include entities performing off-path QoS reservations, NAT traversal components such as ALGs and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and diagnostic tools that passively monitor the network.
For these tools to continue to function without change, the core property of SDP -- that the existing, pre-ICE definitions of the addresses used for media -- the "m=" and "c=" lines and the rtcp attribute -- must be retained.
For this reason, an updated offer must be sent.
