<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> defines ICE candidate exchange as the process for ICE agents (Initiator and Responder) to exchange their candidate information required for ICE processing at the agents. For the purposes of this specification, the candidate exchange process corresponds to the <a href="#RFC3264" class="xref">[RFC3264]</a> Offer/Answer protocol and the terms "offerer" and "answerer" correspond to the initiator and responder roles from <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> respectively.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">Once the initiating agent has gathered, pruned, and prioritized its set of candidates <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a>, the candidate exchange with the peer agent begins.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.1.p.1">Each data stream <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> is represented by an SDP media description ("m=" section).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.2.p.1">Within an "m=" section, each candidate (including the default candidate) associated with the data stream is represented by an SDP candidate attribute.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.2.p.2">Prior to nomination, the "c=" line associated with an "m=" section contains the connection address of the default candidate, while the "m=" line contains the port and transport protocol of the default candidate for that "m=" section.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.2.p.3">After nomination, the "c=" line for a given "m=" section contains the connection address of the nominated candidate (the local candidate of the nominated candidate pair) and the "m=" line contains the port and transport protocol corresponding to the nominated candidate for that "m=" section.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.1.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.1.4">4.2.1.4.</a> Lite Implementations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.4.p.1">An ICE lite implementation <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> MUST include an SDP ice-lite attribute.  A full implementation MUST NOT include that attribute.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.1.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.1.5">4.2.1.5.</a> ICE Extensions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.5.p.1">An agent uses the SDP ice-options attribute to indicate support of ICE extensions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.5.p.2">An agent compliant to this specification MUST include an SDP ice-options attribute with an "ice2" attribute value <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a>. If an agent receives an SDP offer or answer that indicates ICE support, but that does not contain an SDP ice-options attribute with an "ice2" attribute value, the agent can assume that the peer is compliant to <a href="#RFC5245" class="xref">[RFC5245]</a>.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.2">4.2.2.</a> RTP/RTCP Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.1">If an agent utilizes both RTP and RTCP, and separate ports are used for RTP and RTCP, the agent MUST include SDP candidate attributes for both the RTP and RTCP components and SDP rtcp attribute SHOULD be included in the "m=" section, as described in <a href="#RFC3605" class="xref">[RFC3605]</a></p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">In the cases where the port number for the RTCP is one higher than the RTP port and the RTCP component address is the same as the address of the RTP component, the SDP rtcp attribute MAY be omitted.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.3">If the agent does not utilize RTCP, it indicates that by including b=RS:0 and b=RR:0 SDP attributes, as described in <a href="#RFC3556" class="xref">[RFC3556]</a>.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.5.p.1">The agents will proceed with the ICE procedures defined in <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> and this specification if, for each data stream in the SDP it received, the default destination for each component of that data stream appears in a candidate attribute. For example, in the case of RTP, the connection address, port, and transport protocol in the "c=" and "m=" lines, respectively, appear in a candidate attribute and the value in the rtcp attribute appears in a candidate attribute.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.5.p.2">This specification provides no guidance on how an agent should proceed in the cases where the above condition is not met with the few exceptions noted below: </p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The presence of certain application layer gateways might modify the transport address information as described in <a href="#sec-alg-sip" class="xref">Section 8</a>.  The behavior of the responding agent in such a situation is implementation dependent. Informally, the responding agent might consider the mismatched transport address information as a plausible new candidate learnt from the peer and continue its ICE processing with that transport address included.  Alternatively, the responding agent MAY include an "a=ice-mismatch" attribute in its answer for such data streams.  If an agent chooses to include an "a=ice-mismatch" attribute in its answer for a data stream, then it MUST also omit "a=candidate" attributes, MUST terminate the usage of ICE procedures and <a href="#RFC3264" class="xref">[RFC3264]</a> procedures MUST be used instead for this data stream.  </li>
<li>The transport address from the peer for the default destination is set to IPv4/IPv6 address values "0.0.0.0"/"::" and port value of "9".  This MUST NOT be considered as a ICE failure by the peer agent and the ICE processing MUST continue as usual.  </li>
<li>In some cases, the controlling/initiator agent may receive the SDP answer that may omit "a=candidate" attributes for the data stream, and instead include a media level "a=ice-mismatch" attribute.  This signals to the offerer that the answerer supports ICE, but that ICE processing was not used for this data stream. In this case, ICE processing MUST be terminated for this data stream and <a href="#RFC3264" class="xref">[RFC3264]</a> procedures MUST be followed instead.  </li>
<li>The transport address from the peer for the default destination is an FQDN. Regardless of the procedures used to resolve FQDN or the resolution result, this MUST NOT be considered as a ICE failure by the peer agent and the ICE processing MUST continue as usual.  </li>

<li>If the checklist state associated with a data stream is Running, the agent recomputes the checklist. If a pair on the new checklist was also on the previous checklist, its candidate pair state is copied over.  Otherwise, its candidate pair state is set to Frozen. If none of the checklists are active (meaning that the candidate pair states in each checklist are Frozen), appropriate procedures in <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> are performed to move candidate pair(s) to the Waiting state to further continue ICE processing.  </li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">The "ice-ufrag" and "ice-pwd" attributes convey the username fragment and password used by ICE for message integrity.  Their syntax is: </p>
<pre>
ice-pwd-att           = "ice-pwd:" password
ice-ufrag-att         = "ice-ufrag:" ufrag
password              = 22*256ice-char
ufrag                 = 4*256ice-char
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.2">The "ice-pwd" and "ice-ufrag" attributes can appear at either the session-level or media-level. When present in both, the value in the media-level takes precedence.  Thus, the value at the session-level is effectively a default that applies to all data streams, unless overridden by a media-level value. Whether present at the session or media-level, there MUST be an ice-pwd and ice-ufrag attribute for each data stream.  If two data streams have identical ice-ufrag&#8217;s, they MUST have identical ice-pwd&#8217;s.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.3">The ice-ufrag and ice-pwd attributes MUST be chosen randomly at the beginning of a session (the same applies when ICE is restarting for an agent).  </p>
<p><a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> requires the ice-ufrag attribute to contain at least 24 bits of randomness, and the ice-pwd attribute to contain at least 128 bits of randomness. This means that the ice-ufrag attribute will be at least 4 characters long, and the ice-pwd at least 22 characters long, since the grammar for these attributes allows for 6 bits of information per character.  The attributes MAY be longer than 4 and 22 characters, respectively, of course, up to 256 characters. The upper limit allows for buffer sizing in implementations.  Its large upper limit allows for increased amounts of randomness to be added over time.  For compatibility with the 512 character limitation for the STUN username attribute value and for bandwidth conservation considerations, the ice-ufrag attribute MUST NOT be longer than 32 characters when sending, but an implementation  MUST accept up to 256 characters when receiving.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.5">5.5.</a> "ice-pacing" Attribute</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.1">The "ice-pacing" is a session level attribute that indicates the desired connectivity check pacing (Ta interval), in milliseconds, that the sender wishes to use. See section 14.2 of <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> for more information regarding selecting a pacing value.  The syntax is: </p>
<pre>

pacing-value              = 1*10DIGIT
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.2">If absent in an offer or answer the default value of the attribute is 50 ms, which is the recommended value specified in <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.5.p.4">Once both agents have indicated the pacing value they with to use, both agents MUST use the larger of the indicated values.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.5.6">5.6.</a> <a href="#sec-ice-options" id="sec-ice-options">"ice-options" Attribute</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.1">The "ice-options" attribute is a session- and media-level attribute.  It contains a series of tokens that identify the options supported by the agent.  Its grammar is: </p>
<pre>
ice-options           = "ice-options:" ice-option-tag
                          0*(SP ice-option-tag)
ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.5.6.p.2">The existence of an ice-option in an offer indicates that a certain extension is supported by the agent and it is willing to use it, if the peer agent also includes the same extension in the answer. There might be further extension specific negotiation needed between the agents that determine how the extension gets used in a given session. The details of the negotiation procedures, if present, MUST be defined by the specification defining the extension (<a href="#sec-iana-ice-options" class="xref">Section 10.2</a>).  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">All the ICE agents MUST follow the procedures defined in section 11 of <a href="#RFC8445" class="xref">[RFC8445]</a> for sending keepalives. The keepalives MUST be sent regardless of whether the data stream is currently inactive, sendonly, recvonly, or sendrecv, and regardless of the presence or value of the bandwidth attribute. An agent can determine that its peer supports ICE by the presence of "a=candidate" attributes for each media session.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7">
<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> SIP Considerations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Note that ICE is not intended for NAT traversal for SIP signaling, which is assumed to be provided via another mechanism <a href="#RFC5626" class="xref">[RFC5626]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">When ICE is used with SIP, forking may result in a single offer generating a multiplicity of answers. In that case, ICE proceeds completely in parallel and independently for each answer, treating the combination of its offer and each answer as an independent offer/answer exchange, with its own set of local candidates, pairs, checklists, states, and so on.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#sec-latency" id="sec-latency">Latency Guidelines</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">ICE requires a series of STUN-based connectivity checks to take place between endpoints. These checks start from the answerer on generation of its answer, and start from the offerer when it receives the answer.  These checks can take time to complete, and as such, the selection of messages to use with offers and answers can affect perceived user latency.  Two latency figures are of particular interest. These are the post-pickup delay and the post-dial delay. The post-pickup delay refers to the time between when a user "answers the phone" and when any speech they utter can be delivered to the caller. The post-dial delay refers to the time between when a user enters the destination address for the user and ringback begins as a consequence of having successfully started alerting the called user agent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Two cases can be considered&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one where the offer is present in the initial INVITE and one where it is in a response.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.1">7.1.1.</a> Offer in INVITE</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.1">To reduce post-dial delays, it is RECOMMENDED that the caller begin gathering candidates prior to actually sending its initial INVITE, so that the candidates can be provided in the INVITE. This can be started upon user interface cues that a call is pending, such as activity on a keypad or the phone going off-hook.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.2">On the receipt of the offer, the answerer SHOULD generate an answer in a provisional response as soon as it has completed gathering the candidates. ICE requires that a provisional response with an SDP be transmitted reliably. This can be done through the existing Provisional Response Acknowledgment (PRACK) mechanism <a href="#RFC3262" class="xref">[RFC3262]</a> or through an ICE specific optimization, wherein, the agent retransmits the provisional response with the exponential backoff timers described in <a href="#RFC3262" class="xref">[RFC3262]</a>. Such retransmissions MUST cease on receipt of a STUN Binding request with the transport address matching the candidate address for one of the data streams signaled in that SDP or on transmission of the answer in a 2xx response. If no Binding request is received prior to the last retransmit, the agent does not consider the session terminated. For the ICE lite peers, the agent MUST cease retransmitting the 18x after sending it four times since there will be no Binding request sent and the number four is arbitrarily chosen to limit the number of 18x retransmits.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.3">Once the answer has been sent, the agent SHOULD begin its connectivity checks.  Once candidate pairs for each component of a data stream enter the valid list, the answerer can begin sending media on that data stream.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.1.p.4">However, prior to this point, any media that needs to be sent towards the caller (such as SIP early media <a href="#RFC3960" class="xref">[RFC3960]</a>) MUST NOT be transmitted. For this reason, implementations SHOULD delay alerting the called party until candidates for each component of each data stream have entered the valid list.  In the case of a PSTN gateway, this would mean that the setup message into the PSTN is delayed until this point. Doing this increases the post-dial delay, but has the effect of eliminating 'ghost rings'.  Ghost rings are cases where the called party hears the phone ring, picks up, but hears nothing and cannot be heard. This technique works without requiring support for, or usage of, preconditions <a href="#RFC3312" class="xref">[RFC3312]</a>. It also has the benefit of guaranteeing that not a single packet of media will get clipped, so that post-pickup delay is zero.  If an agent chooses to delay local alerting in this way, it SHOULD generate a 180 response once alerting begins.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1.2">7.1.2.</a> Offer in Response</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.1">In addition to uses where the offer is in an INVITE, and the answer is in the provisional and/or 200 OK response, ICE works with cases where the offer appears in the response.  In such cases, which are common in third party call control <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a>, ICE agents SHOULD generate their offers in a reliable provisional response (which MUST utilize <a href="#RFC3262" class="xref">[RFC3262]</a>), and not alert the user on receipt of the INVITE.  The answer will arrive in a PRACK.  This allows for ICE processing to take place prior to alerting, so that there is no post-pickup delay, at the expense of increased call setup delays.  Once ICE completes, the callee can alert the user and then generate a 200 OK when they answer.  The 200 OK would contain no SDP, since the offer/answer exchange has completed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.2.p.2">Alternatively, agents MAY place the offer in a 2xx instead (in which case the answer comes in the ACK).  When this happens, the callee will alert the user on receipt of the INVITE, and the ICE exchanges will take place only after the user answers.  This has the effect of reducing call setup delay, but can cause substantial post-pickup delays and media clipping.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> SIP Option Tags and Media Feature Tags</h1>
<p><a href="#RFC5768" class="xref">[RFC5768]</a> specifies a SIP option tag and media feature tag for usage with ICE.  ICE implementations using SIP SHOULD support this specification, which uses a feature tag in registrations to facilitate interoperability through signaling intermediaries.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> Interactions with Forking</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">ICE interacts very well with forking.  Indeed, ICE fixes some of the problems associated with forking.  Without ICE, when a call forks and the caller receives multiple incoming data streams, it cannot determine which data stream corresponds to which callee.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">With ICE, this problem is resolved.  The connectivity checks which occur prior to transmission of media carry username fragments, which in turn are correlated to a specific callee.  Subsequent media packets that arrive on the same candidate pair as the connectivity check will be associated with that same callee.  Thus, the caller can perform this correlation as long as it has received an answer.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.4">7.4.</a> Interactions with Preconditions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">Quality of Service (QoS) preconditions, which are defined in <a href="#RFC3312" class="xref">[RFC3312]</a> and <a href="#RFC4032" class="xref">[RFC4032]</a>, apply only to the transport addresses listed as the default targets for media in an offer/answer.  If ICE changes the transport address where media is received, this change is reflected in an updated offer that changes the default destination for media to match ICE&#8217;s selection. As such, it appears like any other re-INVITE would, and is fully treated in RFCs 3312 and 4032, which apply without regard to the fact that the destination for media is changing due to ICE negotiations occurring "in the background".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">Indeed, an agent SHOULD NOT indicate that QoS preconditions have been met until the checks have completed and selected the candidate pairs to be used for media.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.3">ICE also has (purposeful) interactions with connectivity preconditions <a href="#RFC5898" class="xref">[RFC5898]</a>.  Those interactions are described there.  Note that the procedures described in <a href="#sec-latency" class="xref">Section 7.1</a> describe their own type of "preconditions", albeit with less functionality than those provided by the explicit preconditions in <a href="#RFC5898" class="xref">[RFC5898]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.5">7.5.</a> Interactions with Third Party Call Control</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.1">ICE works with Flows I, III, and IV as described in <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a>.  Flow I works without the controller supporting or being aware of ICE.  Flow IV will work as long as the controller passes along the ICE attributes without alteration.  Flow II is fundamentally incompatible with ICE; each agent will believe itself to be the answerer and thus never generate a re-INVITE.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.2">The flows for continued operation, as described in Section 7 of <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a>, require additional behavior of ICE implementations to support.  In particular, if an agent receives a mid-dialog re-INVITE that contains no offer, it MUST restart ICE for each data stream and go through the process of gathering new candidates.  Furthermore, that list of candidates SHOULD include the ones currently being used for media.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.8">
<a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#sec-alg-sip" id="sec-alg-sip">Interactions with Application Layer Gateways and SIP</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) are functions present in a Network Address Translation (NAT) device that inspect the contents of packets and modify them, in order to facilitate NAT traversal for application protocols.  Session Border Controllers (SBCs) are close cousins of ALGs, but are less transparent since they actually exist as application-layer SIP intermediaries.  ICE has interactions with SBCs and ALGs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">If an ALG is SIP aware but not ICE aware, ICE will work through it as long as the ALG correctly modifies the SDP.  A correct ALG implementation behaves as follows: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The ALG does not modify the "m=" and "c=" lines or the rtcp attribute if they contain external addresses.  </li>
<li>If the "m=" and "c=" lines contain internal addresses, the modification depends on the state of the ALG: <ul>
<li>If the ALG already has a binding established that maps an external port to an internal connection address and port matching the values in the "m=" and "c=" lines or rtcp attribute, the ALG uses that binding instead of creating a new one.  </li>
<li>If the ALG does not already have a binding, it creates a new one and modifies the SDP, rewriting the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">Unfortunately, many ALGs are known to work poorly in these corner cases.  ICE does not try to work around broken ALGs, as this is outside the scope of its functionality.  ICE can help diagnose these conditions, which often show up as a mismatch between the set of candidates and the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attributes.  The ice-mismatch attribute is used for this purpose.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">ICE works best through ALGs when the signaling is run over TLS.  This prevents the ALG from manipulating the SDP messages and interfering with ICE operation.  Implementations that are expected to be deployed behind ALGs SHOULD provide for TLS transport of the SDP.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.6">If an SBC is SIP aware but not ICE aware, the result depends on the behavior of the SBC.  If it is acting as a proper Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), the SBC will remove any SDP attributes it doesn&#8217;t understand, including the ICE attributes.  Consequently, the call will appear to both endpoints as if the other side doesn&#8217;t support ICE.  This will result in ICE being disabled, and media flowing through the SBC, if the SBC has requested it.  If, however, the SBC passes the ICE attributes without modification, yet modifies the default destination for media (contained in the "m=" and "c=" lines and rtcp attribute), this will be detected as an ICE mismatch, and ICE processing is aborted for the call.  It is outside of the scope of ICE for it to act as a tool for "working around" SBCs.  If one is present, ICE will not be used and the SBC techniques take precedence.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> Security Considerations</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.1">9.1.</a> Attacks on the Offer/Answer Exchanges</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">An attacker that can modify or disrupt the offer/answer exchanges themselves can readily launch a variety of attacks with ICE.  They could direct media to a target of a DoS attack, they could insert themselves into the data stream, and so on.  These are similar to the general security considerations for offer/answer exchanges, and the security considerations in <a href="#RFC3264" class="xref">[RFC3264]</a> apply.  These require techniques for message integrity and encryption for offers and answers, which are satisfied by the TLS mechanism <a href="#RFC3261" class="xref">[RFC3261]</a> when SIP is used.  As such, the usage of TLS with ICE is RECOMMENDED.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.2">9.2.</a> Insider Attacks</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.p.1">In addition to attacks where the attacker is a third party trying to insert fake offers, answers, or STUN messages, there are several attacks possible with ICE when the attacker is an authenticated and valid participant in the ICE exchange.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.9.2.1">9.2.1.</a> <a href="#sec-voice-hammer" id="sec-voice-hammer">The Voice Hammer Attack</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.1">The voice hammer attack is an amplification attack.  In this attack, the attacker initiates sessions to other agents, and maliciously includes the connection address and port of a DoS target as the destination for media traffic signaled in the SDP. This causes substantial amplification; a single offer/answer exchange can create a continuing flood of media packets, possibly at high rates (consider video sources).  This attack is not specific to ICE, but ICE can help provide remediation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.2">Specifically, if ICE is used, the agent receiving the malicious SDP will first perform connectivity checks to the target of media before sending media there.  If this target is a third-party host, the checks will not succeed, and media is never sent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.3">Unfortunately, ICE doesn&#8217;t help if it&#8217;s not used, in which case an attacker could simply send the offer without the ICE parameters.  However, in environments where the set of clients is known, and is limited to ones that support ICE, the server can reject any offers or answers that don&#8217;t indicate ICE support.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.2.1.p.4">SIP User Agents (UA) <a href="#RFC3261" class="xref">[RFC3261]</a> that are not willing to receive non-ICE answers MUST include an "ice" Option Tag <a href="#RFC5768" class="xref">[RFC5768]</a> in the SIP Require Header Field in their offer. UAs that reject non-ICE offers will generally use a 421 response code, together with an Option Tag "ice" in the Require Header Field in the response.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">The "a=remote-candidates" attribute exists to eliminate a race condition between the updated offer and the response to the STUN Binding request that moved a candidate into the Valid list.  This race condition is shown in <a href="#fig-race-flow" class="xref">Figure 1</a>.  On receipt of message 4, agent L adds a candidate pair to the valid list.  If there was only a single data stream with a single component, agent L could now send an updated offer.  However, the check from agent R has not yet generated a response, and agent R receives the updated offer (message 7) before getting the response (message 9).  Thus, it does not yet know that this particular pair is valid.  To eliminate this condition, the actual candidates at R that were selected by the offerer (the remote candidates) are included in the offer itself, and the answerer delays its answer until those pairs validate.  </p>

<p class="figure">Figure 2: Role Conflict Flow</p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.3">This flow is a variation on flow III of RFC 3725 <a href="#RFC3725" class="xref">[RFC3725]</a>.  In fact, it works better than flow III since it produces fewer messages.  In this flow, the controller sends an offerless INVITE to agent A, which responds with its offer, SDP1.  The agent then sends an offerless INVITE to agent B, which it responds to with its offer, SDP2.  The controller then uses the offer from each agent to generate the answers.  When this flow is used, ICE will run between agents A and B, but both will believe they are in the controlling role.  With the role conflict resolution procedures, this flow will function properly when ICE is used.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.4">At this time, there are no documented flows that can result in the case where both agents believe they are controlled.  However, the conflict resolution procedures allow for this case, should a flow arise that would fit into this category.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.D">Appendix D.</a> Why Send an Updated Offer?</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.1">Section 11.1 describes rules for sending media.  Both agents can send media once ICE checks complete, without waiting for an updated offer.  Indeed, the only purpose of the updated offer is to "correct" the SDP so that the default destination for media matches where media is being sent based on ICE procedures (which will be the highest-priority nominated candidate pair).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.p.2">This raises the question&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;why is the updated offer/answer exchange needed at all? Indeed, in a pure offer/answer environment, it would not be.  The offerer and answerer will agree on the candidates to use through ICE, and then can begin using them.  As far as the agents themselves are concerned, the updated offer/answer provides no new information.  However, in practice, numerous components along the signaling path look at the SDP information.  These include entities performing off-path QoS reservations, NAT traversal components such as ALGs and Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and diagnostic tools that passively monitor the network.  For these tools to continue to function without change, the core property of SDP&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that the existing, pre-ICE definitions of the addresses used for media&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the "m=" and "c=" lines and the rtcp attribute&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;must be retained.  For this reason, an updated offer must be sent.  </p>
